def rule_based_suggestions(request_payload: Dict) -> List[str]:
    """
    Generate sustainability improvement suggestions using static, rule-based heuristics.

    How it works:
    - We evaluate each (predicate, message) pair in RULES against the raw request payload.
    - If the predicate returns True, we include the message.
    - We deduplicate messages so we don't repeat the same tip twice.

    Fallback:
    - If no rules fire at all, we still return a generic "you're already good" style suggestion.

    Parameters:
        request_payload: dict directly from the API call body (not the dataclass),
                         e.g. {
                           "transport": "air",
                           "materials": ["plastic", "aluminum"],
                           "packaging": "recyclable",
                           ...
                         }

    Returns:
        A list of unique human-readable suggestions (List[str]).
